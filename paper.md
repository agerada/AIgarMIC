# Summary

The measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is regarded as the gold standard test of antimicrobial
susceptibility. The agar dilution method is a reference method for MIC testing, but the interpretation of agar dilution
plates is time-consuming and subjective. `AIgarMIC` is a Python package for automated interpretation of agar dilution
experiments [@geradaDeterminationMinimumInhibitory2024].
